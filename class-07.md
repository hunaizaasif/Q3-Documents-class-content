# **🤖 1 August 2025: Diving into OpenAI Agents SDK 🤖**
Here’s a quick recap of today's session where we revisited context management and learned how to dynamically instruct and trace our agents.
~~----------------------------------------~~
## 🤔 Revision: Context Management
We reviewed **Context Management**, which controls the info an agent uses. `local_context` is key for giving your tools access to local data and code dependencies when they run.
* **Docs**: https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/context
~~----------------------------------------~~
## Today's Topics: Dynamic Instructions & Tracing
### 📝 Dynamic Instructions
This lets your agent adapt its core instructions during a conversation, like a smart assistant changing its approach based on the situation.
* **Docs**: https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/agents/#dynamic-instructions
* **Code**: https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/tree/main/01_ai_agents_first/09_dynamic_instructions
~~----------------------------------------~~
### 🕵️‍♂️ Tracing: See How Your Agent Works!
**Tracing** helps you debug by showing you every thought and step your agent takes.
* **On the OpenAI Platform**: View traces on your dashboard (requires a paid API key).
    * **Link**: https://platform.openai.com/logs?api=traces
* **Local Tracing**: Run and view traces on your own machine for more control.
* **External Tracing Providers**: Integrate with third-party tools like Braintrust or Logfire for advanced monitoring.
